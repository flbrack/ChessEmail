# ChessEmail

As a bit of an online chess addict, I use both chess.com and lichess.org. Inspired by the personalised 'year in review' email that chess.com send their users, I thought it would be nice to have a weekly email of my combined stats from both websites.
Both websites have APIs, which I use to calculate information such as win percentage, current rankings and a few charts thrown in for good measure.
