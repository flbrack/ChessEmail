# ChessEmail

As a bit of an online chess addict, I use both chess.com and lichess.org. Inspired by the personalised yearly stats roundup that chess.com email their users, I thought it would be nice to have a weekly email that gave me my combined stats from each webiste, with things such as win percentage, current rankings and a few charts thrown in for good measure.
